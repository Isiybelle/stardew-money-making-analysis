# Stardew Early-Game Revenue Analysis
Analysis of separate Stardew specialties to determine the best way to get the most money early-game


I love the game Stardew a perhaps excessive amount, but I wanted to take a deeper look into some of the ways to make money in early-game stages. Just like a lot of games, money plays a big factor on growth, so it can be important to 'get rich quick' in some cases. 

For my analysis, I wanted to look at 3 ways to generate revenue: farming, fishing, and foraging. Stardew promotes itself as a farming sim, but there's tons more you can do than simply farm, and plenty of those ways make money. I did not include ranching or use of artisnal machines that result in higher pay because I only wanted to consider early game when the player either hasn't unlocked those items or they're too expensive - hence the use of thsi analysis.

I used Power BI to implement my data sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicaebrown/stardew-valley-full-catelog) and my own webscraping. All my findings are present as a Power BI file.
